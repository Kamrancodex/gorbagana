## üöÄ How It Works

### **1. Game Flow**

```
Player Joins ‚Üí Pays Entry Fee ‚Üí Plays Game ‚Üí Wins Prizes
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì
  WebSocket    GOR Transaction   Real-time   Blockchain
 Connection    Validation       Gameplay    Transfer
```

### **2. Prize Distribution**

1. **Entry Fee Collection**: Players pay GOR to join games
2. **Transaction Validation**: System verifies payments on blockchain
3. **Escrow Tracking**: Validated payments tracked in prize pool
4. **Game Completion**: Winner determined through gameplay
5. **Prize Transfer**: Real GOR tokens sent to winner's wallet

### **3. Financial Model**

- **Entry Fee**: 1 GOR per player
- **Prize Pool**: Total entry fees collected
- **Platform Fee**: 10% of prize pool
- **Winner Prize**: 90% of prize pool (1.8 GOR in 2-player game)

## üîç Problems We Solved

### **Problem 1: Fake Prize Distribution**

- **Issue**: Original system only logged fake transactions
- **Solution**: Implemented real blockchain transfers with actual GOR tokens
- **Result**: Winners receive actual cryptocurrency prizes

### **Problem 2: Entry Fee Collection**

- **Issue**: Players paid fees but money didn't reach platform wallet
- **Solution**: Created validated escrow system with transaction verification
- **Result**: All entry fees properly tracked and validated

### **Problem 3: Private Key Format Issues**

- **Issue**: Inconsistent private key parsing between JSON and base58 formats
- **Solution**: Unified private key handling across all modules
- **Result**: Platform wallet loads correctly with any key format

### **Problem 4: Transaction Confirmation Failures**

- **Issue**: Network timeouts causing games to think payments failed
- **Solution**: Enhanced retry logic with fallback confirmation methods
- **Result**: Reliable transaction confirmation even during network issues

### **Problem 5: Insufficient Platform Balance**

- **Issue**: Platform couldn't distribute prizes due to empty wallet
- **Solution**: Platform wallet funding system and balance verification
- **Result**: Sustainable prize distribution with funded platform wallet
